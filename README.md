Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.  
A data-driven analysis of the company's performance over the course of the years 2005 - 2006 is done. The size of the dataset is 4MB and is in the .tar file format. I started by creating the data dictionary and extracting the identity relationship. After cleaning and sorting the dataset, I wrote multiple SQL queries to create a data profile of summary statistics, filter and order data and join tables and write subqueries and CTEs to answer key business questions and objectives.

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy.

* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
